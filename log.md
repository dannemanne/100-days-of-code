# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 18, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Experimented with Dark Mode designs

**Thoughts:** Starting out easy within my comfort zone. The Foundation framework is something I have been
working with several times and I find it straight forward to make changes. I like that because when it comes
to the actual design, that is not something I am usually comfortable with by myself, and often rely on
feedback from others. But I did some quick research on Dark Mode color palettes and tried something new
for my blog.
