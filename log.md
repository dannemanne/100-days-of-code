# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 18, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Experimented with Dark Mode designs

**Thoughts:** Starting out easy within my comfort zone. The Foundation framework is something I have been
working with several times and I find it straight forward to make changes. I like that because when it comes
to the actual design, that is not something I am usually comfortable with by myself, and often rely on
feedback from others. But I did some quick research on Dark Mode color palettes and tried something new
for my blog.

### Day 2: January 19, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Started learning Elixir on Exercism.io

**Thoughts:** Today was fun, but also a reminder that reading the docs for a language is not the same
as coming up with solution when faced with a task or problem. It takes time just to learn the DSL of the
standard modules (what's the name and syntax for joining a List into a String, etc.). I enjoy the ellegance
of using the pipe operator to chain functions together, but I also realised that I am not using it in the
most efficient way running loops multiple times when it could have been nested instead. But good progress overall today.
