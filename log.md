# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 18, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Experimented with Dark Mode designs

**Thoughts:** Starting out easy within my comfort zone. The Foundation framework is something I have been
working with several times and I find it straight forward to make changes. I like that because when it comes
to the actual design, that is not something I am usually comfortable with by myself, and often rely on
feedback from others. But I did some quick research on Dark Mode color palettes and tried something new
for my blog.

### Day 2: January 19, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Started learning Elixir on Exercism.io

**Thoughts:** Today was fun, but also a reminder that reading the docs for a language is not the same
as coming up with solution when faced with a task or problem. It takes time just to learn the DSL of the
standard modules (what's the name and syntax for joining a List into a String, etc.). I enjoy the ellegance
of using the pipe operator to chain functions together, but I also realised that I am not using it in the
most efficient way running loops multiple times when it could have been nested instead. But good progress overall today.

### Day 3: January 20, 2020

**Today's Progress**: UI Tips & Tricks and Elixir practice

**Thoughts:** I concider the design part of my work to be one of my major weaknesses. But I want to improve
even though I doubt I'm ever going to consider myself a designer. By reading about rules and guidelines for
design patterns, I believe I can become better by using a systematic approach to the design, just like I
would for my other tasks. Feels good so far!

Also some more Elixir practice, and indirectly some math challenges because of the tasks offered on Exercism.
I'm a little split between pushing ahead with less efficient solutions in terms of algorithms, just to improve
my proficiency with Elixir. But I think it's better long term if I spend more time on a task, just to find
a better solution to it all-around.

### Day 4: January 21, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Experimented with using different fonts in UI

**Thoughts:** Tried out the effects of using different fonts and what effects you can get from using
font weight, colour and opacity in different ways.

### Day 5: January 22, 2020

**Today's Progress**: More Elixir practice on Exercism.io

**Thoughts:** Solved the problem I previously got stuck on. Convert integers to Roman literals. But I belive
the reason I got stuck was more about me not tackling the algorithm before diving into Elixir code and
functions. Once I solved the theory, I was able to focus more on how to write it down, and then it came
together nicely. Of course, when comparing my solution to other people in the community, there's obviously
room for improvement. But that's a good thing!

### Day 6: January 23, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Finished the second half of React on FreeCodeCamp

**Thoughts:** Difficult to find the motivation after a long day at work today. Decided to power through but
do something easy. The React lessons are easy at this stage, but it still requires you to read the task and
write the solution, so keeps the mind focused at least.
